# Smart-Resume-Analyzer-Job-Matcher
Smart Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher is a simple yet powerful AI/ML-based project that helps users evaluate how well their resume matches a given job description. Built using Python and Streamlit, this tool uses NLP techniques to extract skills and keywords from resumes (in .pdf or .docx format) and compares them with the provided job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. It then generates a match score (in percentage), helping job seekers understand their fit for a role. The app supports resume parsing through libraries like docx2txt and pdfminer.six, while SpaCy is used for natural language processing. The project includes separate files like utils.py for parsing and cleaning functions, a data folder for storing sample job descriptions, and a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. To run the project, users can install the required libraries, and run the application using streamlit run app.py. Once launched in the browser, users can upload resumes and see an interactive comparison and score instantly. This project is helpful for both freshers and professionals looking to refine their resumes or better understand job expectations.
